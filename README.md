## PROBLEM STATEMENT
The dashboard should provide real-time insights into key performance indicators (KPIs) related to our sales data. This will enable us to make informed decisions, monitor our progress, and identify trends and opportunities for growth.
Sales Overview:
Year-to-Date (YTD) Total Sales
Year-over-Year (YOY) Growth in Total Sales
Average Price Analysis:
YTD Average Price
YOY Growth in Average Price
Cars Sold Metrics:
YTD Cars Sold
YOY Growth in Cars Sold

1. **YTD Sales Weekly Trend:** Display a line chart illustrating the weekly trend of YTD sales. The X-axis should represent weeks, and the Y-axis should show the total sales amount.
2. **YTD Total Sales by Body Style:** Visualize the distribution of YTD total sales across different car body styles using a Pie chart.
3. **YTD Total Sales by Colour:** Present the contribution of various car colours to the YTD total sales through a donut chart.
4. **YTD Cars Sold by Dealer Region:** Showcase the YTD sales data based on different dealer regions using a bar chart to visualize the sales distribution geographically.
5. **Company-Wise Sales Trend in Grid Form:** Provide a tabular grid that displays the sales trend for each company. The grid should showcase the company name along with their YTD sales figures.
